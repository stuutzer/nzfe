          As a forest owner, you have the opportunity to earn carbon credits by
          sequestering carbon in your forest land. These carbon credits are
          tradable assets that can be sold on the market, providing you with
          additional economic benefits. The New Zealand Forest Service can
          assist in determining the status of your land and help you leverage
          the opportunities presented by carbon emissions trading. Their
          professional team can provide support, helping you understand and
          capitalize on the opportunities presented by carbon credits, promoting
          sustainable forest management and additional economic returns.
